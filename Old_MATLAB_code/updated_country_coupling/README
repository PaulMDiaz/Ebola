This directory contains code which takes individual country simulations and
couples them (via "transportation terms"). The new coupled differential equation
is in new_equation.tex.

========

Instructions to run code contained in this directory:

run seir_minimizer_main, which provides k_val (which are the coupling
coefficients). This uses final_graphing which creates plots.

run [psi, prop_psi] = varyPsi(k_val), which gives the effect of varying psi on the infected
proportions

run plotPsi(prop_psi), which creates the plot psi_plot.eps

========

seir_minimizer_main is the main function, which minimizes the error
seir_parameter_fit returns. Running seir_minimizer_main does everything! To make
sure seir_minimizer_main works correctly, make sure the parameter values are
correct (according to the fits from the uncoupled simulations).

seir_parameter_fit(IG) is a function which takes an initial guess of the transfer
coefficients (the phi values), and returns the error between the model and data
values.

find_coupled_ic splices the ODEs together. Since the time spans of the data are
different for each country, find_coupled_ic will simulate a given country (not
coupled!) through some initial time so that the simulations can start at the same
time.

SEIHRRR( ... ) is the coupled ODE. It consists of the single SEIHRRR model three
times, and each parameter passed to the function is a triplet (so
alpha1=[alpha1_lib, alpha1_guin, alpha1_sl])
