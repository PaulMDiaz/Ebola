Each country has their own version of this model. The coupling term which allows
for transit of exposes individuals between countries is $\phi_{ij}$. Let's say
that $\phi_{12}$ is from Liberia to Guinea, $\phi{21}$ is from Guinea to
Liberia, $\phi_{13}$ is from Liberia to Sierra Leone, and etc. I assume that
only exposed are transferred since the susceptibles moving around doesn't matter
much, and I assume that once you're infected, you won't be going anywhere.
Likewise, people in a hospital will be stationary. And the dead can't go
anywhere either, unless we allow for zombies.



\begin{equation} \left\lbrace

    \frac{dE_i}{dt} &=  \beta_1 S_i I_i +\beta_2 S_i R_{I,i} +\beta_3S_iH_i-
    \delta E_i - \phi_{ij}E_i + \phi_{ji} E_j\\
\frac{dI_i}{dt} &=  \delta E_i - \gamma_1 I_i-\psi I_i\\
\frac{dH_i}{dt} &= \psi I_i - \gamma_2 H_i \\ %see next two comments

The above equation is valid for $i=1,2,3$ representing Liberia, Guinea, and
Sierra Leone respectively.
